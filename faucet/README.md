## Deployment and more than deployment

Manage all containers. Http Server listening to github hooks and local .git hooks.

## build images
The official docker hub is too slow building the images. Build it on private server and push it to testing and deployment.

## something stand alone
nginx and this deployment are not included in docker cluster. They are deployed alone.
