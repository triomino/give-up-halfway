# API layer (built with low level tools)
Part of backend. API layer between front end and back end.

Try using tools with lower layers.

## build
run dependencies.sh and build.sh.

## running
run deploy.sh and start.sh
 
## Challenges
service model: Use tomcat(servlet) + nginx rather than spring MVC.

tasks: Do not use gradle, maven or ant. Write scripts to run tasks like building, testing and deployment.

Database: Maybe java persistent even JDBC will be used. But firstly all data are stored in memory.

## Just For Learning Something
This project will be abandoned if I feel these tools are too difficult to use.
